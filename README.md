This is the core Omni open source framework. OmniBase provides a series of debugging aids
for class allocation and initialization, an alternative assertions mechanism, several
Objective-C runtime manipulation aids, and a very reliable, cross-platform implementation
of `+load` (called `+didLoad`).

This framework is based on the [Omni open-source frameworks](https://github.com/omnigroup/OmniGroup).
It has been modified to be compatible with CocoaPods.
